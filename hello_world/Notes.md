# Getting Started

Noirup seems to work

Nvim highlighting is there which is nice, no install instructions (I guess if you're really struggling here, you're not gonna have a fun time moving forwards)

Small bit of config as I'm not often setting up syntax highlighting but added a PR to the README
 
## First steps

 Nargo and build worked great, 300 MiB of download randomly happening was certainly something (for ignite)

Silent passing is a bit anticlimactic. Would have been nice to see an output
